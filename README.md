# GitTools
Some tools for git.

# Git Repository Mirror Fetch Tool

It's a `Bash` script and saved in `grmftool` directory.

For example:
By default, executing
```bash
grmftool Orange23333/GitTools
```
for get this repository with `git fetch` command.

It's default fetch repository from `GitHub` with automatically execute `git checkout FETCH_HEAD` function, and saved files in `/d/Work/mirrors/git/github.com`.

You can change default values of variables in the script.
Looking up `#*` in the script to find variables modifiable variable.

# Get GitHub Repositories List Library in Python

It's a `Python` package and saved in `pyGetGitHubRepositoriesList` directory.

it is preview version now.

And it is written with `GitHub Copilot` before. So, it with a lot of descriptive comments, and different language styles.
I'm tring to publish a new license for code written with `GitHub Copilot` or other `AI` code named `Work with GitHub Copilot License`(`WGHCL`) for those code.
And I'll modify these blobs later.
